# predictive-testing

`predictive-testing` is a test runner, simlar to [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava), that focuses on testing predictive functions (e.g. search, auto-complete, or ML).

## When you should use `predictive-testing`

- you have tons of test cases, and your tests purely compare
  inputs and outputs of the function under test
- you are testing a statistical model, or a predictive function, where 100%
  coverage is impossible or impractical
- you are testing a (flaky) legacy system
